/week 5: 3D design & printing

<p>
i have never tried 3d printing before. so as a first attempt, i decided to find a readymade stl design on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com">thingiverse</a> and try printing it on the prusa printer in the lab. my favorite animals are bears and so i found a design of a brown bear (ursus arctos). <a download href='BrownBear.stl'>here</a> is the stl file i used. i imported the design into prusaslicer and then scaled it down so it wouldn't take too long to print. 

</p>

</p>

<p>
despite scaling the design down, the printing time was still extremely long. so i set the resolution at 0.20mm and was able to get the printing time down to 14 minutes. i exported the <a download href='BrownBear_gcode.gcode'>g-code</a> to a flash drive, plugged it into the prusa printer and started the print. and here is what the print looked like!

<p>
next, i used the computer in the lab, the turntable & camera, and revoscan & revostudio to try some photogrammetry. i found some 3d printed objects lying around in the lab and decided to try to scan them. here is an interesting white blob i found. 
</p>

<p>
this was my photogrammetric scan on revostudio. <a download href='blob.stl'>here</a> is the ply file for the blob. 
</p>

<p>
i also found a very expressive face of a blue cartoon character.

<p>
this was the photogrammetric scan of the partial action figure on revostudio. <a download href='head.stl'>here</a> is the ply file for the head.
