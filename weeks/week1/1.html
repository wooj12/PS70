<p>
I have a couple of rough sketches for final project ideas that come out of inconveniences from my own life: wellness suite, cocktail aide, the ultimate hiker’s backpack, and a film lighting aide.
</p>
<p>
  <li>
The first idea is a suite of products designed for at-home wellness over the wintery months. I elaborate on this idea below in the section titled "wellness suite."
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  <li>
The second idea is the ultimate hiker’s backpack, equipped with lightweight solar-panels, a hydration-reminder system with a water purification device, a modular attachment system for customized storage, emergency features (e.g. integrated GPS bacon), a docking system for energy-harvesting walking sticks, and an insulated compartment for keeping food items cool/warm.
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  <li>
The third idea is an intelligent lighting assistant for filmmakers, which can control lighting setups based on the desired mood or scene requirements, using a combination of sensors and inputs from the cinematographer.
  </li>
</p>
<p>
  <li>
The fourth and final idea is a cocktail aide: a calibrated scale that would weigh each cocktail ingredient precisely, alongside a web-app that tells the user which sequence and amount of mixers to add for a perfectly calibrated cocktail.
  </li>

<p>
While I was living abroad in Seoul and Tokyo, one of the things I loved was how accessible self-care and wellness centers are compared to the options available in Downtown Boston, where there exist a limited number of hotel-attached spas or  pop-up facilities that are hard to come by as a campus-bound student.
</p>
<p>
My first idea involves a suite of wellness products for students surviving the Boston winter, including a portable tent sauna, a massage gun, and/or a mist-making humidifier.
</p>
<p>
i. For the portable tent sauna, I will have to first determine the materials of the tent (e.g. a frame, a frame cover that is lightweight, durable, non-wooden, and insulates heat - likely nylon fabric), figure out the heating mechanism (e.g. infrared, electric, steam), and finally decide on other add-ons (e.g. temperature-control system, thermometer, timers and safety shut-offs, floor-heating pad, a chair, an accompanying ice-bath).
</p>
<p>
ii. For the massage gun, I will have to develop a mechanism that creates the percussive motion/vibration, likely involving a motor with an eccentric load. I will also have to design the handle and the body for ease of use, and consider ways to minimize noise without sacrificing power.
</p>
<p>
iii. For the humidifier, I will decide on the type of humidifier I would like to build (e.g. ultrasonic, evaporative), design the water tank for refilling/cleaning, and integrate a control system for mist output, humidity levels, and safety features (e.g. auto shut-off when water levels are low). I can also decide whether to add any other supplementary features (e.g. night light, white noise making machine), etc.

  <p>
I will start by sketching out a few first iterations of the sauna and start with that as my first project. If I get any further, I could try to build a suite of products beyond 1.i, although there may be other unanticipated challenges that pop up during the process. I am looking forward to the digital fabrication journey with PS70 and build out some cool projects!
